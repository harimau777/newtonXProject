* All of the components and their associated logic are written.
* All utility functions for interacting with the API are written.
* Note: I am assuming what parameters transferMoney will take since they are not documented.

To Do:
* I still need to finish implement handling of the authentication token.
* I still need to add logic to prevent the user from transferring money to themselves.
* Verify that everything works.
* Write a real README
* Implement unit tests.
* Remove unused code from Create React App
* Implement CSS.
* Verify accessibility, particularly around the modal.
